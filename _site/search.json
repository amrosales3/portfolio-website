    "text": "My experience with analytics goes beyond traditional marketing — I’ve used data and tech tools to help athletes improve performance, optimize throwing mechanics, and better understand how their bodies move. This work combines biomechanics, pitch analysis, and high-level player development strategies.\n\n\n\n\nRapsodo & Trackman: Used for collecting pitch tracking data, including velocity, spin rate, spin axis, and pitch movement\n\nDriveline Motion Capture: Applied biomechanics tools to analyze throwing efficiency and joint sequencing\n\nBaseball Savant & FanGraphs: Researched pro and college-level pitchers to break down performance metrics and trends\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed countless pitchers from high school to pro using data from Rapsodo, Trackman, and Savant\n\nStudied pitch movement profiles, vertical approach angles, release points, and arm slot data\n\nHelped athletes understand how their body moves and how to better coordinate their mechanics for max velocity and efficiency\n\nDesigned personalized throwing plans and training cues based on motion capture and pitch feedback\n\nEducated athletes on using their data to track progress and stay healthy\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the intersection of analytics and physical performance is what sets modern athletes apart. I use data not just for analysis — but for action: helping pitchers improve how they move, throw, recover, and perform.\n\nMy background bridges the gap between numbers and movement — blending data-driven insights with real athletic outcomes."
