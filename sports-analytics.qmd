# Applying Analytics to Pitching & Athletic Development

My experience with analytics goes beyond traditional marketing — I’ve used data and tech tools to help athletes improve performance, optimize throwing mechanics, and better understand how their bodies move. This work combines biomechanics, pitch analysis, and high-level player development strategies.

## Tools & Tech I’ve Worked With

- **Rapsodo** & **Trackman**: Used for collecting pitch tracking data, including velocity, spin rate, spin axis, and pitch movement  
- **Driveline Motion Capture**: Applied biomechanics tools to analyze throwing efficiency and joint sequencing  
- **Baseball Savant** & **FanGraphs**: Researched pro and college-level pitchers to break down performance metrics and trends

## What I’ve Done

- Analyzed countless pitchers from high school to pro using data from Rapsodo, Trackman, and Savant  
- Studied pitch movement profiles, vertical approach angles, release points, and arm slot data  
- Helped athletes understand how their body moves and how to better coordinate their mechanics for max velocity and efficiency  
- Designed personalized throwing plans and training cues based on motion capture and pitch feedback  
- Educated athletes on using their data to track progress and stay healthy

## Why It Matters

Understanding the intersection of analytics and physical performance is what sets modern athletes apart. I use data not just for analysis — but for **action**: helping pitchers improve how they move, throw, recover, and perform.
